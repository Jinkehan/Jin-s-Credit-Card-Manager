I added the following cards in the Card_Pictures folder:

Look up online and add the card details and benefits for the new card in 
the file card-benefits.json, be sure to follow exsiting format so it works 
for the app. 

Note:
1. For card benefits, only those that have monetary value are considered benefits,
not cash back. For instance, like an Amex Gold card, $10 per month uber credit
is a benefit, but 4x points on grocery shopping is not.
